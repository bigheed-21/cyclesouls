Our impact, as humans, on environment is staring at us in plain sight every day. Whether it's a BBC series by David Attenborough, a Netflix special or another news article about the negative effect we are having on the environment which we inherited. We certainly wouldn't blame people for thinking that its too late and what can individual people do to solve such global problems however here are 5 small simple adjustments that we made to our lifestyle that has acted as a great starting point for us.

## Glass Milk bottles

We are very lucky to have a [community driven shop](https://communitycarrot.scot/) in our town where glass milk bottles are the default however there are now a lot of businesses online that are offering 'old-fashioned' milk deliveries that use glass bottles. 

There is definitely some sort of nostalgia at play here and I am sure our grandparents generation is wondering why this is such a hot topic at the moment considering it was probably very common back in the day however this is an easy way to start reducing single use plastic.

## Laundry and cleaning refills

Tired of throwing out those plastic soap dispensers? We were too. We decided to buy some refillable glass bottles that we could refill with one of the many scented options offered by [Faith & Nature](https://www.faithinnature.co.uk/). Buying environmentally friendly is often seen as more expensive and this is one where you will have to weigh up the initial cost against an often repeated purchase that will sneak into your weekly shopping now and again. 

We also switched to a refill for our washing up liquid which in contrast to the change for soap dispensers is a no-brainer as it is easily cheaper over time. For a 750ml bottle it costs us just over Â£1.50 for a refill and at present we are refilling the bottle around every 4 weeks. That's 12/13 less single-use plastics every year. 

## Buy loose fruit and vegetables

When you step back and think about it, why are produce items such as carrots, potatoes and celery sold in plastic bags? It really makes no sense at all! Don't get us wrong, supermarkets do have some options for loose products however these are few and far between and it is very easy to be attracted to the offers where the buy in bulk option is often the one in a plastic bag. 

When we have local produce on our doorstep it is very difficult to justify not buying loose. A common pushback to this alternative is that a lot of people are based in densely populated cities but businesses such as [Oddbox](https://www.oddbox.co.uk/) and [Eversfield](https://www.eversfieldorganic.co.uk/) are quashing that trend by offering delivery directly aimed at these sorts of markets so as always there is plenty of alternatives out there.

## Washable cleaning cloths

After ditching those single-use sponges (you know the ones) it is easy to realise the unnecessary waste that those sponges create. You don't need to get fancy with these as most online marketplaces will sell some sort of version of these. Finished using the cloth, pop it in the wash and reuse. No more throwing out sponges every few days and of course the plastic packaging that these packs come in!

## Next Steps

Although these are only small changes it certainly got us thinking about what other straightforward changes we could make to our lifestyle in order to be environmentally conscious. Are we going to save the planet with these adjustments? No. But these are all positive steps in the right direction.
