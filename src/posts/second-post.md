## Small blurb about us / how we met

For anyone who knows us, we are definitely not the best decision makers around (this is an under statement!). We are notorious for overthinking, however, when it comes to creating life lasting moments, we never shy away for one second. Although we pursued an end-to-end cycle before we met it is one of the main protagonists that brought us together in life.

Cycle Souls is made up of Craig England and Donna Berrie. Since we met around 2 and a half years ago we have moved from the city of Edinburgh to the coastal town of Dunbar where we are still pursuing cycling as hobby. The summer before we met, for different reasons, cycling was more than a hobby as we both decided to take on Britain's most famous cycling route, Land's End to John O'Groats (LEJOG) although one of us cycling it in the opposite direction!

## Brief History of LEJOG/JOGLE

There are iconic cycling challenges all around the world, Cairo to Cape Town and Race Across America to name a few however the LEJOG holds a special place in the hearts of the UK cycling community. The route has been completed on penny farthings to tandems and taken on by young and old. No matter who you speak to about their experience of the cycle, everyone of those people have never regretted taking on the challenge.

While the world record, at the time of writing, stands at 41 hours and 4 minutes we both had slightly different timescales in mind! Our attempts weren't about breaking records or proving to people that we could achieve goals that we set ourselves, it was about proving that we could do it to ourselves. Although we shared this motivation our reasons for wanting to take on the challenge were different. 

## Why do the cycle? (Donna and Craig)

Why would anyone want to cycle almost 1,000 miles over 9/10 days in the British summer time? 

### Donna



### Craig

It's often said that writing things down makes it more likely that you will actually follow through. I can remember setting myself this goal by doing exactly that and with my 30th birthday fast approaching, this seemed like the perfect time to be able to tick this off. I had always enjoyed keeping fit however I ramped this up in order to take on this challenge in the best possible physical condition. I bought myself a static trainer for my road bike and started preparing around late February with my start date set for the 12th of August. 

## Our different experiences (in a group vs individual)

### Donna

### Craig

I made the (crazy!) decision to cycle the 1,000 mile route self-supported. I purchased some [Alpkit](https://alpkit.com) cycling bags, made a list of essentials that I would need through the help of some generous people that I reached out to through the [UKCycleChat Twitter page](https://twitter.com/UKCycleChat) and booked some Airbnb's and I was ready to go. When I say it like that it sounds simple however there was a lot of things to take into consideration. What if I get injured? How would I deal with a severe mechanical issue? What if my Garmin and phone stop working, how would I still navigate through that day? All of these plus hundreds more scenarios were running through my head. If there is one piece of advice that I would pass onto anyone looking to do something similar it would prepare, and when you think you have prepared enough, prepare even more! 

## Final thoughts - lead onto daily entries as the next post.

Despite this journey has been documented many times before we wanted a place where we could tell our own story. Over the coming weeks/months we will be going through each day of our journey where you will find out about the difference of doing it as part of a group vs self-supported, general tips for taking on such a challenge and many funny anecdotes that happened along the way.
